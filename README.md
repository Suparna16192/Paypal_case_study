# Paypal_case_study
This project explores and analyzes a PayPal transaction dataset to uncover patterns, identify potential anomalies, and generate actionable insights. The primary objectives were to understand transaction trends, analyze user behavior, and evaluate risk factors through descriptive and exploratory data analysis.
Here are some SQL project-style questions you could run on this dataset:

Basic Queries

1.List the top 10 highest-value transactions (amount + date + currency).


select transaction_amount, transaction_date, currency_code from transactions
order by transaction_amount desc
limit 10;


2.Show all transactions done in INR during 2023.


select transaction_amount, transaction_date, currency_code from transactions
where currency_code = "INR" and year(transaction_date) = "2023"; 


3.Find the total transaction amount per currency.


select sum(transaction_amount), currency_code from transactions
group by currency_code;


4.Count how many transactions each sender made.


select sender_id, count(transaction_id) as no_of_transactions from transactions
group by sender_id; 


5.Find the average transaction amount in USD.


select currency_code, avg(transaction_amount) as avg_transaction_amount from transactions
where currency_code = "USD"; 


Joins & Lookups

6.Show all transactions with the sender and recipient merchant names (join transactions with merchants twice).


select T.sender_id, M1.business_name as sender_name, T.recipient_id, M2.business_name as recipient_name, T.transaction_amount from transactions T
join merchants M1 on T.sender_id = M1.merchant_id
join merchants M2 on T.recipient_id = M2.merchant_id; 


7.List transactions along with the country names of both sender and recipient.


select T.sender_id, C.country_name as sender_country, T.recipient_id, C2.country_name as recipient_country, T.transaction_amount from transactions T
join merchants M1 on T.sender_id = M1.merchant_id
join merchants M2 on T.recipient_id = M2.merchant_id
join countries C on M1.country_id = C.country_id
join countries C2 on M2.country_id = C2.country_id;


8.Find the top 5 countries by total transaction amount (consider both senders and recipients).


select C.Country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) as total_transactions_senders from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.sender_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
group by C.Country_name
order by total_transactions_senders desc
limit 5;


select C.Country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) as total_transactions_recipients from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.recipient_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
group by C.Country_name
order by total_transactions_recipients desc
limit 5; 


9.Show merchants from "India" along with their total transaction amount received.


select M.business_name, C.country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.recipient_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
where C.country_name ="India"
group by M.business_name, C.country_name;

select * from countries
where country_name = "India"; 

Date & Time Analysis

10.Find the month with the highest total transaction value.


select * from transactions;

select date_format(transaction_date, "%Y-%m") as month, sum(transaction_amount) as total_monthly_transaction from transactions
group by month
order by total_monthly_transaction desc
limit 1; 


11.Show year-over-year growth in transaction amounts.


with cte as (select year(transaction_date) as year, sum(transaction_amount) as total_yearly_transaction from transactions
group by year
order by year)

select year, total_yearly_transaction, lag(total_yearly_transaction)over(order by year) as previous_year_transaction,
total_yearly_transaction-lag(total_yearly_transaction)over(order by year) as year_on_year_growth from cte; 



12.Find all transactions that happened on weekends.


select transaction_id, transaction_date, dayname(transaction_date) as day, transaction_amount from transactions
where dayofweek(transaction_date) in (1,7); 


13.Get the first transaction date for each merchant using FIRST_VALUE().


select * from merchants; 
select * from transactions;

select distinct M.merchant_id, M.business_name, first_value(T.transaction_date)over(partition by T.sender_id order by T.transaction_date) as first_transaction from transactions T
join merchants M on T.sender_id = M.merchant_id;



14.Calculate the time difference in days between consecutive transactions for each sender using LAG().


with cte as (select transaction_id, sender_id, transaction_date, lag(transaction_date)over(partition by sender_id order by transaction_date) as previous_transaction_date from transactions)
select *, datediff(transaction_date, previous_transaction_date) as days_between_transaction from cte;




Window Functions & Analytics

15.Rank all transactions per sender by amount (RANK()).


select transaction_id, sender_id, transaction_amount, rank()over(partition by sender_id order by transaction_amount) as transaction_rank from transactions;



16.For each sender, find the previous transaction amount (LAG()) and difference from the current.


with cte as (select transaction_id, sender_id, transaction_amount, lag(transaction_amount)over(partition by sender_id) as pervious_transaction_amount from transactions)
select *, round((transaction_amount-pervious_transaction_amount),2) as difference from cte; 



17.Find the largest transaction per currency using MAX() OVER().


select distinct currency_code, max(transaction_amount)over(partition by currency_code) as max_transaction_amount from transactions
order by max_transaction_amount desc; 



18.Get cumulative transaction amounts per sender ordered by date (SUM() OVER()).


select sender_id, transaction_date, transaction_amount, sum(transaction_amount)over(partition by sender_id order by transaction_date) as cumulative_amount from transactions;



Data Cleaning & Integrity

19.Find transactions with a blank currency_code.

select * from transactions
where currency_code =""; 

20.Show transactions where the sender or recipient ID doesnâ€™t exist in merchants.

SELECT t.* FROM transactions t
LEFT JOIN merchants m_sender ON t.sender_id = m_sender.merchant_id
LEFT JOIN merchants m_recipient ON t.recipient_id = m_recipient.merchant_id
WHERE m_sender.merchant_id IS NULL OR m_recipient.merchant_id IS NULL;
