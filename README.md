# Paypal_case_study

### This project explores and analyzes a PayPal transaction dataset to uncover patterns, identify potential anomalies, and generate actionable insights. The primary objectives were to understand transaction trends, analyze behavior of the merchants, and evaluate risk factors through descriptive and exploratory data analysis.

join merchants M1 on T.sender_id = M1.merchant_id
join merchants M2 on T.recipient_id = M2.merchant_id; 

```
**Insight**: List of all the transactions along with the name of the sender and recipient.

---

### 7.List transactions along with the country names of both sender and recipient.

join countries C2 on M2.country_id = C2.country_id;

```

**Insight**: List of sender's and recipient's along with the transaction amounts.

---
### 8.Find the top 5 countries by total transaction amount (consider both senders and recipients).
```sql
select C.Country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) as total_transactions_senders
from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.sender_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
group by C.Country_name
order by total_transactions_senders desc
limit 5;


select C.Country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) as total_transactions_recipients
from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.recipient_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
group by C.Country_name
order by total_transactions_recipients desc
limit 5; 

```
**Insight**: List of top 5 senders and top 5 recipients countries along with total transaction amount.

---

### 9.Show merchants from "India" along with their total transaction amount received.
```sql
select M.business_name, C.country_name, sum(T.transaction_amount) from transactions T 
join Merchants M on T.recipient_id = M.merchant_id
join countries C on M.country_id = C.country_id
where C.country_name ="India"
group by M.business_name, C.country_name;

select * from countries
where country_name = "India"; 

```
**Insight**: India is not included in the countries data sheet.

---

## Date & Time Analysis

### 10.Find the month with the highest total transaction value.
```sql

select * from transactions;

select date_format(transaction_date, "%Y-%m") as month, sum(transaction_amount) as total_monthly_transaction from transactions
group by month
order by total_monthly_transaction desc
limit 1; 

```
**Insight**: The highest total transaction value if for the month of Jan, 2024.

---

### 11.Show year-over-year growth in transaction amounts.
```sql
with cte as (select year(transaction_date) as year, sum(transaction_amount) as total_yearly_transaction from transactions
group by year
order by year)

select year, total_yearly_transaction, lag(total_yearly_transaction)over(order by year) as previous_year_transaction,
total_yearly_transaction-lag(total_yearly_transaction)over(order by year) as year_on_year_growth from cte; 

```
**Insight**: Year-over-year growth is significantly low, which may suggest market saturation, seasonal impact, etc.

from transactions T
join merchants M on T.sender_id = M.merchant_id;

---
### 14.Calculate the time difference in days between consecutive transactions for each sender using LAG().

with cte as (select transaction_id, sender_id, transaction_date, lag(transaction_date)over(partition by sender_id order by transaction_date) as previous_transaction_date
from transactions)
select *, datediff(transaction_date, previous_transaction_date) as days_between_transaction from cte;

from transactions;

```
**Insight**: Ranked transactions for all the senders as per the transaction amount.

---
### 16.For each sender, find the previous transaction amount (LAG()) and difference from the current.

```sql
with cte as (select transaction_id, sender_id, transaction_amount, lag(transaction_amount)over(partition by sender_id) as pervious_transaction_amount
from transactions)
select *, round((transaction_amount-pervious_transaction_amount),2) as difference from cte; 

```
**Insight**: Previous transction amount for each sender and the difference with the current amount.

---

### 17.Find the largest transaction per currency using MAX() OVER().

```sql
select distinct currency_code, max(transaction_amount)over(partition by currency_code) as max_transaction_amount
from transactions
order by max_transaction_amount desc; 

```
**Insight**: GBP, EUR and JPY has the largest transaction per currency.

---
### 18.Get cumulative transaction amounts per sender ordered by date (SUM() OVER()).

```sql
select sender_id, transaction_date, transaction_amount, sum(transaction_amount)over(partition by sender_id order by transaction_date) as cumulative_amount
from transactions;

```
**Insight**: Cumulative transaction amounts per sender according to transaction dates.

---

## Data Cleaning & Integrity

### 19.Find transactions with a blank currency_code.
```sql
select * from transactions
where currency_code ="";

LEFT JOIN merchants m_recipient ON t.recipient_id = m_recipient.merchant_id
WHERE m_sender.merchant_id IS NULL OR m_recipient.merchant_id IS NULL;
```

**Insight**: List of transactions without the sender's or recipient's ID.
